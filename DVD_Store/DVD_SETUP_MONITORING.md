# Setup monitoring
The goal in this part of the workshop is to setup up all necessary components that are needed in order to use inspectIT for the monitoring.

The prerequisite for this part is that you have finished the [setup part](DVD_SETUP.md) of the workshop.

## InfluxDB and Grafana
The inspectIT is using InfluxDB time-series database as the storage for all the monitoring data. The data from the influxDB can be then visualized with the Grafana web-based user interface.

### Install InfluxDB
Visit the [InfluxDB download page](https://www.influxdata.com/downloads/#influxdb) and follow the instructions in order to install the *InfluxDB Time-Series Data Storage*. Alternatively, install influxDB with the provided installers from the USB stick. The inspectIT is compatible with version 1.x of InfluxDB. Start the *influxdb* service and verify that everything is working by opening the web-based view of InfluxDB located by default on the [http://localhost:8083](http://localhost:8083). (*hint*: From influxdb v1.2.x the Admin UI is deprecated and inactive by default, meaning you cannot access it on port 8083. Instead check if port 8086 is open and used by the influxdb process*). 

In the inspectIT UI open the ![Configure Repository](../images/build.gif?raw=true) *Configure Repository* dialog and perform the following changes:

1. In the preference page *influxDB* set the following properties:

Property | Value
--- | ---
Host | localhost
Port | 8086
Username | root
Password | root
Database Name | inspectit

2. In the preference page *Database* set the property **Write Data to influxDB** to true (On).

Now, in the CMR details view, located in the **Respository Manager**, you should see that the status of the **InfluxDB** service is **connected**. Alternatively, you should see the followng message in the log output of the CMR process: 
```[service-thread-1] INFO  .server.influx.dao.InfluxDBDao - |-InfluxDB Service active and connected...```.

### Install Grafana
Visit the [Grafana download page](http://grafana.org/download/) and install the Grafana distribution for your operating system. Start Grafana service. Verify that Grafana is running by visiting the Grafana's web-based UI located by default on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Login into the UI using the default credentials ```admin / admin```.


The last thing to do is to connect Grafana to the **inspectIT** database that we previously created in the InfluxDB instance. 

1. Open the Grafana administration page (click on the icon in the top left corner) and select *Data Sources -> Add New*.
2. Then add following information for the new data source:

Property | Value
--- | ---
Name | inspectit
Type | InfluxDB
Default | âœ“
URL | http://localhost:8086
Access | proxy
Basic Auth | 
Database | inspectit 
User | admin
Password | admin

#### Import inspectIT dashboard

The inspectIT has predefined basic dashboards for the Grafana. Select the *Import* option in the dashboard navigation menu and import one or more available dashboards that could be found in the [inspectit-labs repository](https://github.com/inspectit-labs/dashboards).

There is also one predefined dashboard available on [GrafanaLabs](https://grafana.com/dashboards/1691). Just put the id '1691' in field 'Grafana.net Dashboard' on the Import Dashboard Dialog.

##### Enrich your monitoring data

You might wonder why you only see *Unknown Transactions* in your dashboards. We will improve this in the next section [Business Transactions](DVD_BUSINESS_TRANSACTIONS.md). Defining Business Transactions enriches your monitoring data and let you focus on important functionality of your business (like purchases in the DVD Store application).
